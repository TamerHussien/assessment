## Road blocks

my road with blocking form the far begining i encountered a lot of techanical issues like compatibility between Angular material and angular also i got another issue "cannot resolve scholldetail component"
and last issue i got is "ERROR in SchooldetailComponent is not an NgModule"
and all of this takes along timeto resolve and ran out my time in doing problem solving search instead of complete the assessment.
